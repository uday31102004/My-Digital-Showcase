            <h4>Project 1</h4>
            <h5>Crop Yield Prediction using Machine Learning</h5>
            <p>Developed and implemented a comprehensive model for the prediction of yield
                using various algorithms</p>
                <p>It can be widely used for predicting yield based on real time sources such as
                    rainfall,land,etc.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h4>Project 2</h4>
            <h5>Battery Management System in EV</h5>
            <p>Developed a model for better usage of battery in elecric vehicles.</p>
            <p>It is very helpful in protecting the battery from overheat and damage of battery</p>
